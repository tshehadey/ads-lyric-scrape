Mac Miller - 5 O'Clock Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

[Mac Miller:]

Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death

And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress

A marathon grind like I'm runnin' from rest

It's (Five o'clock in the morning)

Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death (Uh)

And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress (Yeah)

But I'm goin' hard 'til there's nothin' left under my chest (Ha ha)



The streets empty 'round five o'clock (Uh-huh)

Driving by the cops (Chyeah)

Low key microscopic to the eyes that watch (Uh-huh)

Everything a hustle when you trying come buy some guap

I'ma keep grinding 'til I'm shining like a diamond watch (Uh-huh)

Me and Bo-head bringin' you the truth (Truth)

With all night sessions we just living in the booth (Yep)

Strong bars like we spittin' out hundred-fifty proof

Take shots, get loose (Oh), 'til you spittin' up yo' food (Oh), like, "Oh"

You see that? I'ma need a recap

Grab a weed sack, chief that 'til my feet flat

I got this covered like a Pro Bowl D-back

Breathe rap and I been known to make the beat clap (Ha ha)

Need cash so I'm tryin' move some trees fast

Tell you where the meat at, ask you where the cheese at (Yo)

People 'round the city see the youngin and respect the grind (Oh)

Puttin' in the extra time (Oh), guaranteed next to shine



Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death

And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress

A marathon grind like I'm runnin' from rest

It's (Five o'clock in the morning)

Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death

And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress

But I'm goin' hard 'til there's nothin' left under my chest




[Boaz:]

I rise before the sun come up and get my day started (Chyeah)

Pray to the most high, I roll up my haze and spark it

And then my paper starts to roll in

Money in paper bags, hammers with laser tags

We grown men

Out on the corner 'til the early morn'

The blood of a hustler getting mines before I was born

You get scorned by these hot-ass bars

From me and Easy Mac

Cruisin' in the 'Lac smoking weed with no seeds in that (No seeds)

There ain't no reason that these other rappers hatin' on us (Why?)

Except these labels anticipating and waiting on us

They get the BBSs, radios play us

Then we blaze in the Benzes

And sit this off on BBSs

And from P.A. to Texas

These niggas know about me

International hustler can't move no snow without me

Or get no dough without me

Niggas gettin' they're stacking on

Early bird get the worm

I'm out here at the crack of dawn




[Mac Miller:]

Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death

And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress

A marathon grind like I'm runnin' from rest

It's (Five o'clock in the morning)

Somebody told me sleep was a cousin of death

And followin' a dollar finds nothin' but stress

But I'm goin' hard 'til there's nothin' left under my chest
