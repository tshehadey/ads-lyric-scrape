Mac Miller - Cruisin' Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Yeah

All these haters (Shit)

They're just forced to hate, you know, no reason (Fuck y'all)

They ain't really know who I am at all (Fuck y'all ma'fuckers, ha ha)

So I guess I kinda gotta introduce myself again to these ma'fuckers

So I'm just like, yeah (
[?]
 do it, Mac)



Pleased to meet ya, find me with a heap of reefer (Yup)

Speakin' ether, I'll whip your ass and crease your sneakers (Ha ha)

Haters, keep the hatin', little faggots figure skatin'

While we figure eightin', seekin' your replacement

And I ain't gon' touch the hate like some bacteria (Nope)

Some nasty-ass food from the cafeteria (Ha)

You'll have and hear me, bruh, if you pass me up at lunch

I'ma beat yo ass, tearin' you in half and eat you up (Yes sir)

Like any given Friday, I roll up to your driveway

Rock you in the face, have you lookin' out and sideways

So step back, 'cause you ain't want it with Mac

The young cat with the rap to leave you flat on your back (Ha ha)

And as a matter of fact, I'm like crack on the track

With my cap to the back, I'm the cat in the hat (Yes sir)

Yeah, we rhymin' like Dr. Seuss

So be careful 'fore you end up on the news

Every time that we... (What?)



Cruise, like we got nothin' to lose

Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth

When we cruise, see, I ain't got nothin' to do

So I'ma roll around the city, smokin' blunts with my crew

When we cruise, like we got nothin' to lose

Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth

When we cruise, see, I ain't got nothin' to do

So I'ma roll around the city, smokin' blunts with my crew (Let's go)



And ain't nobody that do it like Pittsburgh (Nope)

Said, ain't nobody that do it like Pittsburgh (Uh-uh)

I said it twice just in case that you misheard

'Cause this verse like (Sippin' an ounce of sizzurp) (Yeah)

So quit your back talk, I ain't havin' it, boy

Yeah, I'm lookin' fresh right now, straight dazzlin', boy

Light a swisher, now I'm gone (Gone)

What my mind's on, 5's on, laced up, headed out the time bomb

Get your life right, size truck with a white light

Triple X tee and a fresh pair of white Nikes (Ha ha)

I'm writin' like nobody you've seen

'Cause my weed is purple and my money is green

See, I'm hungry for cream with my fitted on lean

If you wanna talk shit, I'ma shit on y'all's team, yup, ha

I rock my fitted to the side

Roll around the city, blowin' piff up in the sky

When we



Cruise, like we got nothin' to lose

Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth

When we cruise, see, I ain't got nothin' to do

So I'ma roll around the city, smokin' blunts with my crew

When we cruise, like we got nothin' to lose

Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth

When we cruise, see, I ain't got nothin' to do

So I'ma roll around the city, smokin' blunts with my crew



The kid raps like lasers, sharp like razors

Rollin' up my weed in some Garcia Vegas, yep (Ha ha)

Fuck a cop tryin' chase me with tasers

I'm runnin' out my crib, then I'm dippin' through the neighbor's (Peace)

Garden, High homie, Marvin the Martian

I wipe my ass with you soft rappers like Charmin (Bitches)

Y'all hungry, I'm starvin' (Yup)

You talkin' shit, oh, I beg your pardon (Hahaha)

Specifics is never gimmicks, I rip it just how I live it

You want it, I'll go and get it, I'm kickin' it so exquisite

The wickedest motherfucker on the block I live at

Shit talk on hip-hop, I'm peelin' your wig back, yup

So where the crib at? (Oh) Where the party at? (Oh)

Where them butt-naked hoes and the Bacardi at? (Oh)

'Cause when I start to rap, it's game over

And I ain't spend a single day sober

When I



Cruise, like we got nothin' to lose

Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth

When we cruise, see, I ain't got nothin' to do

So I'ma roll around the city, smokin' blunts with my crew

When we cruise, like we got nothin' to lose

Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth

When we cruise, see, I ain't got nothin' to do

So I'ma roll around the city, smokin' blunts with my crew (Cruise)
