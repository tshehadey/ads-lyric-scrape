Mac Miller - J's On My Feet Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Yeah

Uh, uh, uh

One time, one time, one time for your goddamn mind



Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

J-J's on my feet, J-J's on my feet

Walk-walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

J-J's on my feet, J-J-J's on my feet

Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet (Yeah)

Babes on my piece, sla-sla-slayin' the beats, yes (Ha, ayy, what's good, baby?)

Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet (Oh, you ain't never heard of me?)

J-J's on my feet, J-J-J's on my feet (Aight, yo)



'Cause it's a banger two, banger two (Uh-huh)

Type of shit on pay-per-view (Yes sir)

Butt-naked she layin'-layin', 'cause you can't tame a zoo

She wild (Yep), she want my child, don't touch that dial

I whisper in her ear, it makes her smile (Ha ha)

Loud as I'm fuckin' her

Smooth like I'm in love with her

Tingles up my spine every time that I'm touchin' her (You know)

I love her like pussy, money, weed

When I'm hungry, I will feed

So for dinner, she cooks food with four different types of cheese

In the sheets, we have dessert until it hurts (Hurts)

Feelin' on her curves (Curves)

I pet up on that pussy 'til it purrs (Purrs)

Touch me, touch me, I'm sure it's her that loves me

'Cause I could make the Virgin Mary fuck me, trust me

Mac like Bernie, havin' sex like Will

Fuck a freaky circus bitch while she still wearin' stilts (Aha)

These J's on my feet and these babes on my piece

See, I have a different girl for every day of the week, like (You know)



Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet (Uh)

J-J's on my feet, J-J's on my feet (Uh, uh)

Walk-walkin' through this world with J's on my feet (Uh)

J-J's on my feet, J-J-J's on my feet (Yep)

Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

Babes on my piece, sla-sla-slayin' the beats, yes

Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

J-J's on my feet, J-J-J's on my feet



Girl, MapQuest my address to access my mattress

I get girls straight outta the pageant (Ha)

No doubt that I'm smashin', I'm askin' her name (What's good, baby?)

You a masterpiece, girl, and that ass is just flame (Yep)

She knows that I'm a rapper and her dad is ashamed

Won't let her out the crib, boy, he's actin' insane (Actin' insane)

She got that cute smile and she laugh at my name (Laugh at my name)

But wanna roll with my peoples, let Mac get that brain (Get that brain)

Yeah, Mac has that game, so see how he plays it

I face piff, rap to a girl and leave her anxious

Girls wanted me when I was chubby with some braces

I bet they like me now 'cause I got money and I'm famous

The taste is delicious, her lips give me kisses (Yep)

Throw her in the kitchen and she's makin' me dishes

Her dinner ain't right, I'll admit it's smellin' awful

That girl can make a batch of Belgian waffles a jawful (Ha ha)



Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

J-J's on my feet, J-J's on my feet

Walk-walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

J-J's on my feet, J-J-J's on my feet

Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

Babes on my piece (Yeah), sla-sla-slayin' the beats, yes

Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

J-J's on my feet, J-J-J's on my feet



Grab a ounce or bigger, then I bounce like Tigger (Peace)

Count three dollars up and grab a pack of some Swishers

I'm feelin' stoned, I got my cigarillo rolled

Filled with green isle like an armadillo's nose (Nose)

I'm sniffin' out the hoes that light the piff and wanna throw

Then we spliffin' up the dro as I'm slippin' off her clothes

Not a player like pun, there's more flavors to come

No long-lastin' girls, they Life Savers, not gum

But I could use her beauty (Beauty)

They can take her to a movie

But that girl be gettin' more love than Lucy

So I can't complain (Complain), or contain these broads

I feel like I'm like the white Flavor Flav with broads

Shorty got a ass, a body, plus her face is bomb

They runnin' after me, yo, restrain 'em, dog

They gon' tackle me (Tackle me)

Rip clothes off and saddle me

Mac, wake ya ass up and hop into reality (Ha ha)

I guess hoes ain't here kissin' my feet

But I do got a fine new bitch every week (Ha ha, best believe)

I said I guess hoes ain't here kissin' feet

But I do got a fine new bitch every week, so don't sleep



Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

J-J's on my feet, J-J's on my feet

Walk-walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

J-J's on my feet, J-J-J's on my feet

Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

Babes on my piece, sla-sla-slayin' the beats, yes

Walkin' through this world with J's on my feet

J-J's on my feet, J-J-J's on my feet
