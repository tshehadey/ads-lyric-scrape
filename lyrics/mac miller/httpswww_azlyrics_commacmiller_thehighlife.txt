Mac Miller - The High Life Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

I'm so high (So high)

Find me somewhere in the sky (High in the sky)

And I know, I know, I know

These days just flow by (Flow by)

When you're so high (So high)

Headed somewhere in the sky (High in the sky)

And you know, you know, you know

These days just flow by (Flow by)

When you're so high (So high)



Yeah

My name is Mac Miller

And you are now livin'

The High Life

Most Dope

Big Jerm, I see ya!

Let's get into it
