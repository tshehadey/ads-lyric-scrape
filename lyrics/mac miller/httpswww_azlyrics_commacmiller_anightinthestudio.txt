Mac Miller - A Night In The Studio Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Ay yo Josh

Ay yo where the fuck you at man?

What you mean you on your way yo'

Our session was at 9 it's fuckin' 11

I'm out here, blowed, smoking Ls

Waiting for yo ass

I don't even think I got

Oh no I definitely still got some weed for the lab

But still when you gonna be here?

Soon? Mother fucker how so

Oh there you are right now

Ay yo what's good bruh?



Ay yo what's good bro

Shit chillin'

Yeah I'm trying to go to the studio or whatever

Yeah I got shit to drop mother fucker

I always got shit to drop damn

Ight you'll meet me there?



I woke up scratched my nuts

Rolled a swisher on the shitter

Got blowed then I light me up a cigarette

The coolest flow coolio a movie roll

Now I'm tryna head up to the lab

I headed to the studio open the door

Say wassup to everybody who was posted before

I'm 'bout to record, they know I'm smokin' of course

Blow some haze in the air, pull out my notebook

Then I head up to the booth, load the beat off my email

Phone on silent, ignorin' calls from females

My man Josh sit down, get the tempo

Put on my headphones

Ight, let's go

I let go intro of the beats startin'

Say a couple words try not to be retarded, huh

'Cause I'm a goofy dude doin' what I choose to do

Eatin' tracks up like some snacks call me Scooby Doo

Now the beat about to drop verse one

It's like a war when the soldier pull the first gun

Everything's blank it's just me and the mic

I don't read a lot, so I try and see what I write

Visualize the melody, hypnotize everybody watching

I hope they ain't blink their eyes

'Cause you don't wanna miss a fucking second

When I'm catching wreck

I be in the booth goin' off try to catch my breath

Couple more bars, couple seconds left

Killin' em softly takin' extra steps

They never guessed I be murderin' and blessin'

Ight the first done but before we start the second

We gotta do mad shit

Doubles and ad-libs

And Josh make it sound like magic

He a old school genius with the pro tools

Tryna school me on everything that the pros do

I tell him that he needs to think it in the book

But for now we making guap just singin' on some hooks

So I don't worry 'bout the chorus

The track gotta hook on it

And my verses with that, they sound good on it

Now I do a second maybe do a third

If I'm in the mood to go crazy with my words

I take a lil' break got some haze to burn

The cats sittin' outside can wait their turn

We makin' classics in the session

Mom's asking me these questions

"When you comin' home? You got school."

Nah, I'm suspended

After this track done burn the last blunt smokin' good

Payin' for my time with stolen goods

Say peace to whoever, outside it's dark

I'm blowed and can't find where the fuck I parked

So I beep the car, oh there it is

Let's go ahead and dip, hop in the whip

Light a cigarette and sit

Gotta ride home ahead of us

Slumped in the back

Tell my man with the whip to bump on my track



Tryna ride out, and I'm high now
