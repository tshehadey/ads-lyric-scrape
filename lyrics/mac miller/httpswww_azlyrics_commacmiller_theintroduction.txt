Mac Miller - The Introduction Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Ayy, it's your boy, the class clown himself, Mac Miller

East End Empire all day

Shout out to my man DJ Mynd Tek (Easy Mac can't cheese)

Coast 2 Coast Mixtapes, look outie



Ayo, microphone check, one-two, one-two (Uh-huh)

My name's Mac, what it do? (What it do?)

I'm formerly known as Easy Mac

But I'm gettin' grown now, so I'm past all that

Mac Miller the rap killer, my track iller (Huh?)

With mixtapes like crack dealers, I stack skrilla (Uh-huh)

Fat Swishers at the spot and the room fog

Go ahead and pick a beat out the jukebox (The jukebox)

You can try and stunt me

If you lucky, you may catch me when I'm hungry (Hungry)

Just grumpy on the beat, takin' all that I can eat

Like a buffet at a holiday suite, know what I mean? (Ha ha)

It's for the green like H&R Block

The jakes try and stop us, so I'm hatin' every cop that I see (Bitch)

There to keep the streets clean (Huh?)

But they as dirty as a homeless dude's jeans

Bitch, please (Ha ha), still mack with ease

And actually, the name change wasn't 'bout the haters laughin' (Laughin')


[?]
 attack like assassins

That's just what the fuck happened (Happened)

Like I said, muhfucker, I still mack easy

Just holla "Mac Miller" when you see me (What's up?)

Now holla "Mac Miller" when you see me (Mac Miller)

I said holla "Mac Miller," it's easy (Mac)
