Mac Miller - Live Free Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

The High Life

This is a message to, uh

All of you who, uh

Don't believe

A'ight? (Ha-ha)



They're gon' try and bring you down (What?), hating's what they do (What?)

But you gotta keep a smile (What?), stay up on your move

Live free, (Live free), live free, (Live free)

Homie, live free, (Live free), live free, (Live free) (Ha-ha)

They're gon' try and tell you no, shatter all your dreams

But you gotta get up, go to bigger, better things

Live free, (Live free), live free, (Live free)

Homie, live free, (Live free), live free, (Live free)



Ayo

Microphone check, one-two, one-two

We good? Just had to make sure I'm comin' through (Uh-huh)

With the driver, Ricky Bobby, more class than a college

And the shine of Liberace, 'bout time that you acknowledge

That the boy here to stay, fired up begin to blaze

Buzzin', now my name gettin' out like a triple play (Uh-huh)

Haters tell you what you can't do, fuck that (Nah)

Say there's everything you can do but rap (Nah)

Shit, I paint pictures with a hot flow

Young Picasso, feel me? I thought so (Thought so)

There's people in the world that are jealous of success

Don't ever second guess yourself, step or get left (Get left)

'Cause we on the march, we ain't waitin' for no man

You can't get distracted by haters or romance (Aha)

So if you sittin' trapped in defeat

Get that monkey off your back, live free



They're gon' try and bring you down, hating's what they do

But you gotta keep a smile, stay up on your move

Live free, (Live free), live free, (Live free)

Homie, live free, (Live free), live free, (Live free)

They're gon' try and tell you no, shatter all your dreams

But you gotta get up, go to bigger, better things

Live free, (Live free), live free, (Live free)

Homie, live free, (Live free), live free, (Live free)



Uh, look, look

And everybody know I got haters like Maino

Actors all phony, give 'em Tonys like Yayo

Flush the bullshit out of music: Drain-O

This a true story type of movie: Fandango

Flamethrower, strange flow

They got me on the top like a halo, a Christmas tree Angel (Yeah)

My team attack the game from all angles (Uh-huh)

Passin' all these rappers, just pussycats: Bengals (Yeah)

Hip-hop's LeBron, nothing better (Aha)

Here to kick you out the game: Braylon Edwards

Fast, Devin Hester, runnin' like six feet

You got a sign on your back like kick me (Uh-huh)

I'm a race bike, six-speed

Nah, you can't get me, move too swiftly

Don't deal with other rappers tryin' gyp me

'Cause I'm way down the road where I live free



They're gon' try and bring you down, hating's what they do

But you gotta keep a smile, stay up on your move

Live free, (Live free), live free, (Live free)

Homie, live free, (Live free), live free, (Live free)

They're gon' try and tell you no, shatter all your dreams

But you gotta get up, go to bigger, better things

Live free, (Live free), live free, (Live free)

Homie, live free, (Live free), live free, (Live free)



Yeah, so for all of you, getting trapped by those who doubt you

Be like "bitch!", and just keep it pushing
