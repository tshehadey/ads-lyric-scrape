Mac Miller - Love My Name Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

[Mac Miller:]

This one right here, whew, this the one

Not you, bitch, the song (Ha ha)




[John Record & Mac Miller:]

Baby, if I don't have money (What?)

Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)

I know you gon' love my name

When you see it on the marquee

In the neon lights (See the neon lights)

In the neon lights (See the neon lights)

In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)

I know you gon' love my name



I usually write rhymes in the BlackBerry

But I went back to the pen for this one (What?)

So I'ma let my fingers do the talkin'

And she probably what they talkin' 'bout (Uh-huh)

Girl, you got to listen (Uh)

I'm in this situation where you got me sittin' waitin'

And I'm losin' all my patience, I just need a vacation (Vacation)

Your friends all player-hatin' (What?)

'Cause I'm the one you always stay awake with (Uh-huh)

Then spend the day with, always wanna walk ya home

And you hate the way my day-to-day is on the road (It's okay)

Front row, know every single song

When she know she comin' home with me, she always bring her thong (Ha ha)

And bring her lingerie whatever mood she in

Put a movie in, got the lights dim

We gon' make love 'til the nights end (What?)

Have you callin' up ya friends like, "Ooh, I like him" (Ha ha)



Baby, if I don't have money (What?)

Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)

I know you gon' love my name

When you see it on the marquee

In the neon lights (See the neon lights)

In the neon lights (See the neon lights)

In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)

I know you gon' love my name




[Mac Miller:]

I know I take ya breath away, darling

Smooth playa, treat you like a princess (Uh-huh)

'Cause love tricky like parallel parking (Ha ha)

A business I won't invest

But I show interest in that slim waist of yours

And I smile when I see that pretty face of yours (What's up?)

Givin' you flavors that you ain't never taste before (Uh-huh)

We gon' make love 'til you achin' sore (Achin' sore)

And baby, don't worry, I'ma be rich

Name in the neon lights, ha ha (In the neon lights)

So how about you give me that kiss?

'Cause you don't wanna sleep tonight (Ha ha)

Your one night love, gon' get swept off ya feet

Yes, get undressed from your breast to ya feet (Breast to ya feet)

Light a cigarette just to stay awake

Liquor got us bangin' like a 808




[John Record & Mac Miller:]

Baby, if I don't have money (What?)

Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)

I know you gon' love my name

When you see it on the marquee

In the neon lights (See the neon lights)

In the neon lights (See the neon lights)

In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)

I know you gon' love my name



Throw your hands up, people, party all night

Celebrate my name in the neon lights

Throw your hands up, people, party all night

Celebrate my name in the neon lights

Throw your hands up (You gon' love my name)

Throw your hands up (You gon' love my name)

Throw your hands up (You gon' love my name)

(You gon' love my name) Throw your hands up (Ha ha)



Baby, if I don't have money (What?)

Then I don't have a heartbeat (That's right)

I know you gon' love my name

When you see it on the marquee

In the neon lights (See the neon lights)

In the neon lights (See the neon lights)

In the neon lights (I know you gon' love my name)

I know you gon' love my name
