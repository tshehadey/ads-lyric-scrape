Mac Miller - Dj CapCom Freestyle Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

[Beedie:]

You are now about to witness the strength of 
[?]

Yo, ayo, CapCom, whaddup!

The business is crazy (You can feel it)

East End Empire and all that

Just some good ol' city loving, ya know? (Ha ha)

PGH, ha, Pittsburgh, whaddup!

Let me get at these fools, yo



So let me in the 
[?]
 'bout the damn 
[?]
 police gettin' cheese

Like they infested with disease

I'm on point, every song I do

I never slip man, always standin' on my two

Look, I stretch brains like elastic, bro

And suffocate paper with a plastic flow

I heard your girl wanna smash, yeah, that's for sure

And he can get licked like a stash o' dough

My cash low like I stay down

The beat bully on the playground

We stayin' in day in, day out

Hopin' I'ma fade-out, but y'all better get used to me

Switch shoes and brain-mode, usefully

Truthfully, we the best in the 'Burgh

We the East End bitch, give a "Yes" if ya heard

Yes-sir, we lie from the 412

You won't believe what ya boy gon' do

Homie, ya sent me

Ha, you know how we do it in PGH, man

Steel city, real gritty, and all that; ya dig it?

Yo, I'm glad to be back, yo

I do it for my city, I do it for my people's, and I do it for hip-hop

Ayo, Mac




[Mac Miller:]

The Empire strikes back

Yeah, it's like that

I keep my hoes clean rockin' it with price tags

See ya 
[?]
 I'm at 
[?]

Take her over to the crib for the night check

It's the life that I choose for the music

The Class Clown, hip-hop's free 
[?]


[?]
 in the 
[?]
, gotta keep it movin'

MCs and beats like this food that I'm chewin'

Shorty what ya doin', oh, you see me lookin' at ya?

Wanna tell all of your friends you fucked a rapper

I'm tryin' to tell ya that I'm down for the cause

So let me see that booty give a round of applause

Oh my God, all these fine women

Liquor in my cup and got my mind spinnin'

Plus a swisher, 'bout to put the piff in

That's the life that I'm livin'!



Livin' just to love

Livin' just for the city

Livin'-livin'-livin' just to love

Livin'-livin'-livin' just for the city
