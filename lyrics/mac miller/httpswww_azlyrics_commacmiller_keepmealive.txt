Mac Miller - Keep Me Alive Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

These memories keepin' me high

Yeah

What up, Sco

Uh, uh

East End Empire, motherfuckers

For life, uh



Homie, I remember everything (uh)

Every single blunt lit

Me and my homies, we was all up on that dumb shit

Hittin' that one lick (one lick), gettin' us dumb rich (yeah)

Bein' extra sneaky, not leavin' thumb prints (huh)

There was little Mac killin' packs of Fun Dip (you know me)

And my people that been with me since a young kid (yeah)

Gettin' caught by my Pops blowin' haze (uh)

Smokin' blunts from my younger through my older days (chyeah)

Nothin' goes to waste, not a day is smashed

There was dough to make (dough to make)

And we was makin' cash (makin' cash)

Bangin' rap 'til the neighbors called the cops (uh-huh)

Beatin' dudes up, throwin' mollywops (get 'em)

Some people say that I'm all just talk

But I'll tell you everything about the block I walked

I wasn't cookin' pies (cookin' pies)

I wasn't tokin' guns (tokin' guns)

But I was lookin' high

Stayin' smokin' blunts (smokin' blunts)

Yeah, I stole a little bit, boy, nothin' is cheap (nah)

Santa stayed puttin' the coal under my tree

And this is peace to my peoples (peoples)

And peace to my enemies (chyeah)

But nothin' keeps me alive like my memories




[Lenny Kravitz & Mac Miller:]

You make me feel alive (These memories keep me alive)

You are my highest high (These memories keepin' me high)

You make me feel alive (These memories keep me alive)

You are my highest high (Memories keepin' me high, yeah)



Yeah, see, all my boys, remember, man

Growin' up, younger to older

Everything, yo

So this to y'all, you know what I'm sayin'?

Aight, but yay, we have had those bad memories too, right?

Everybody got them bad memories

But it's been cool, yo (definitely)

Ha, yeah



But let's get back to the good ones (uh-huh)

We was just chasin' some women, uh (chyeah)

Runnin' the game before we playin' an innin' (uh-huh)

Now we need that cake to the ceilin'

Cook in the kitchen, but these haters is grillin'

Fill the place up with villains

'Cause we all just chillin' now (chillin' now)

Got the illest crowd (illest crowd)

Raisin' the roof, uh, breakin' the ceilin' down (uh-huh)

I'm iller now than when y'all first heard me (chyeah)

Peace to my peoples who listened past the first week

(Listened past the first week) And there's a lot of y'all (chyeah)

So let me take a bow (Take a bow), this to memories (uh-huh)

The drinks is on the house (Yeah)

We came a long damn way from sittin' on the couch (on the couch)

Peace to all my honeys that was takin' off their blouse

You'll miss me when I'm out (I'm out)

You'll need me when I'm gone (gone)

You hatin' forty-year-olds, I'm peein' on your lawn (tsss)

I treat you like a john, the way I treat a beat (yup)

This ain't everything, but I'll let you sneak a peek (Peace)



You make me feel alive (These memories keep me alive)

You are my highest high (These memories keepin' me high)

You make me feel alive (These memories keep me alive)

You are my highest high (Memories keepin' me high, yeah)



Yeah, so that's what I'm sayin', man

The East End Empire

Big Will, Beedie, Q-Cup, TreeJ, Sweet James, D-Rec

All my motherfuckin' boys from back in the day

Everybody

Fran, Tip, Bill, Vinny, Ghost

Ha, all y'all, yo

Let's get it
