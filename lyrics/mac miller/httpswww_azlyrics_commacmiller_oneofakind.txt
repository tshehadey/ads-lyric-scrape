Mac Miller - One Of A Kind Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Ain't nothin' else like me



I ain't nothin' like you, so what is going on? (Mac Miller)

There must be somethin' wrong, you'll love me when I'm gone (Aha)

I'ma keep on doin' me, 'cause you don't even matter (Nah)

You, you just an actor, and I just ain't a rapper (What you are)

No, I'm one of a kind, I'm one of a kind (Ha-ha, Mac Miller, uh)



Here's a prototype that I know you'll like, right

Head into the light on an overnight flight (Aha)

Never in your life you gon' see another me

I tend to catch the eye like a pair of double Ds

I'm here, not the same, I'm a pioneer

Stabbed the game in the heart with a giant spear

Grind to see success, goddamn, it's clear (Uh-huh)


[?]
 shine like a chandelier

I'm goin' through this cake

Spittin' 'bout what you relate

Never can you duplicate

Any of the music made

Gettin' super paid

Lookin' at a future star

They recognize me when I pass 'em in a movin' car

Always worried 'bout findin' out who you are

You know somebody, you gotta look into his heart

Yo mind so blind

I'm ahead of my time

'Cause I'm one of a kind, I'm one of a kind



I ain't nothin' like you, so what is going on?

There must be somethin' wrong, you'll love me when I'm gone

I'ma keep on doin' me, 'cause you don't even matter

No, you, you just an actor, and I just ain't a rapper

No, I'm one of a kind, I'm one of a kind



And my pops said:

"Young man, you ain't ready for the world ahead

Way too much marijuana, always havin' girls in bed

You gon' realize that life ain't a party

Fuck around, you gon' end up starving"

Fuck it, I stay fly, live free, die hard

No Bruce Willis, this the whole nine yards

Thought that I can rhyme bars

Go and buy cars, you gotta grind hard once the sunrise start

In my heart, great things in my future (Uh-huh)

'Cause broke rappers, shit, that's just a rumor (Right?)

I see these diamond chains, mansion in their videos

They must got silly dough, do they really though?

Or is it all just a scam for your eyes?


[?]
 in disguise, goddamn, I can't decide

All these words here come from a mind

Got nothin' to hide, boy, I'm one of a kind



Walkin' through this world, I just take a look around

Ain't nobody here like me, don't nobody got my style

People say I'm different, I assure you that's okay

'Cause I'm way past tomorrow, and you stuck in today



I ain't nothin' like you, so what is going on?

There must be somethin' wrong, you'll love me when I'm gone

I'ma keep on doin' me, 'cause you don't even matter

No, you, you just an actor, and I just ain't a rapper

No, I'm one of a kind, I'm one of a kind
