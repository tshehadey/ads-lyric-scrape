Mac Miller - Swing Set Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Cruising through the city with the windows down blowing

Through a pound ready for another round

Some hoes in the back of the whip and they rolling serving

Pussy like the U.S Open blowing on this

Potent different flavors I done saw em all I be staying

Higher than the Taj Mahal straight epic

So now you can't forget it kicking girls out the crib

Like they got some bad credit when you blowed

And you drunk and you don't give a fuck take this soul

And this funk tell the DJ turn it up purple

Stuff got it stirring in my cup while hoes I get around

Like the wheels on the bus I'm a true player

Original Mac and I keep the pussy popping here listen

To that hoes showing me some love so I'm giving

It back she wanna be Mrs.Mac how you figure that?



Go on and ride me like a swing set

Go on and ride me like a swing set

Up and down, up and down

Ride me like a swing set



Ride, swerve, that's how you do it in the burbs

When you high off the herb and you fly as a bird

With some horny hoes waiting in the burbs

You gotta go, looking fresh with the cap on

And your girlie still wet from the last song

Ladies like Mac Miller ooh I wanna merry him

If it's sex and drugs then I'm heroin

I Pick her up just to ride around

Twistin' somethin' purple have us flyin' to a higher ground

She love ridin' with the kid right here

Shes still gon' be in love this time next year

Cuz I'm a heartbreaker, mover and shaker

She love watchin' what I do with my paper

Love it how I player

Loud like a banger

Lil Mama lip gloss

Mouthful of flavor
