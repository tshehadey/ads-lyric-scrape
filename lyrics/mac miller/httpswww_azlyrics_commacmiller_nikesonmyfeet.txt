Mac Miller - Nikes On My Feet Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

[Nas & Mac Miller:]

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes (Hey, hey)

Nike-Nike-Nikes (Hey), Nike-Nike-Nikes (Ha ha)

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes (We just some motherfuckin' kids)

Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete (Just some motherfuckin' kids)

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes




[Mac Miller:]

Ayy, lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em

Blue suede shoes stay crispy like bacon

Nikes on my feet make my cypher complete, uh

I stay shining like the lights on the street in the night

Revis take me shoppin' when I'm up in New York

Hit the shoe store, go and cop a few more

You at the mall getting dinner at the food court

I'm in LA eatin' twenty-two course

Young boss, bitch, paper in my pockets

I got a closet filled with shoeboxes

Mom said my spending habit little bit obnoxious

But a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit

Used to rock hand-me-downs

Now I buy some clothes, wear 'em out

Hit the club, bitches pull their cameras out

Livin' in a dream, they're beginnin' to believe

My hotel smell like cigarettes and weed

Shit, with what I'm spittin', they should give me a degree

Good liquor, what I'm sippin' isn't cheap, uh

Finna blow, don't snooze, don't sleep

All I really need is some shoes on my feet




[Nas & Mac Miller:]

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes

Nike-Nike-Nikes (Hey), Nike-Nike-Nikes (Hey)

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes (Hey)

Nike-Nike-Nikes (Uh), Nike-Nike-Nikes (We just some motherfuckin' kids, ha ha)

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes




[Mac Miller:]

I make 'em so mad, they got no swag

Pippens on my feet, they're the throwbacks, look

My money good, but these hoes bad

So they stay attached to my gonads, uh

Wakin' up to a few Ls

Open up my closet to that new shoe smell

I guess I'm doin' well

Smokin' all the weed that I used to sell

But once my album goes in the shelves

It's going Nextel how it's finna sell

For now, we're sellin' tapes out my shoebox

Any spot, just set up my shop

You're mad that your girl always says that I'm hot

She buyin' my t-shirts, but she spendin' your guap, uh

Say, "What up?" if you see me around

Nike Airs separate my feet from the ground, it's just




[Nas & Mac Miller:]

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes (Yeah)

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes

Nike-Nike-Nikes, Nike-Nike-Nikes

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes

Nike-Nike-Nikes, Nike-Nike-Nikes
