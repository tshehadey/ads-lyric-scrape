Pop Smoke - Welcome To The Party Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

(This is a Melo beat)



Baby, welcome to the party

I'm off the Molly, the Xan, the lean

That's why I'm movin' retarded

(That's why I'm movin' retarded)

Baby, welcome to the party

I hit the boy up and then I go skate in a 'Rari

Baby, welcome to the party

Bitch I'm a thot, get me lit

Gun on my hip

One in the head, ten in the clip

Baby, baby don't trip

Just lower your tone, 'cause you could get hit



Don't let that Henny in my system (Nah)

I catch a body, next day I forget it (Next day I forget it)

Nigga, Dread just caught a body (Nigga, Dread just caught a body)

And that's on the gang, nigga, I was just with him

Look

Free all my rilla niggas, all my villain niggas

All my killer niggas out the cage

Since a youngin', nigga, I been drillin' niggas

Ma I'm sorry I'm stuck up in my ways

Ain't nobody ever gave me shit with this big chip, I had to get paid

And it's 10k to go on stage and you know the treesh gettin laid



Baby, welcome to the party

I'm off the Molly, the Xan, the lean

That's why I'm movin' retarded

(That's why I'm movin' retarded)

Baby, welcome to the party

I hit the boy up and then I go skate in a 'Rari

Baby, welcome to the party

Bitch I'm a thot, get me lit

Gun on my hip

One in the head, ten in the clip

Baby, baby don't trip

Just lower your tone, 'cause you could get hit



It's Big O92MLBOA, I make a call and it's war

I bet I kick down the door, I bet I send him to the Lord

Got a bad bitch from overseas

Got a 10 pack up in my jeans, I'm in Manhattan in these stores

Don't try and run up on my V

I knock a nigga out his sneaks while I'm shellin' down his V

Double G for the T

No Alicia, I got keys, don't get your car Swiss cheese

Nino cooler than a cooler he still a ooter he don't settle for nothing

Bluffin', pussy boy stop all that bluffin'

Three eighty hold a ruler, I know some niggas that'll shoot you for nothing

Run Ricky, yeah he runnin', run Ricky, yeah he runnin'



Baby, welcome to the party

I'm off the Molly, the Xan, the lean

That's why I'm movin' retarded

(That's why I'm movin' retarded)

Baby, welcome to the party

I hit the boy up and then I go skate in a 'Rari

Baby, welcome to the party

Bitch I'm a thot, get me lit

Gun on my hip

One in the head, ten in the clip

Baby, baby don't trip

Just lower your tone, 'cause you could get hit
