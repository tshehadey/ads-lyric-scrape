My bitch a foreigner and she love to fuck

She suck it up, make her fall in love

Put that on her tongue, Percy on her tongue

She do them walks for us (Walk that shit), make her one of us

The gas that I'm smokin' potent

The ice on my neck snowin'

I'm dark skin, glowin'

Off the Percy, I'm rollin'

Valet, park it

I'm screamin', I'm barkin'

They like, "Poppy, why you startin'?"

Pop a Perc', go retarded (Woo)

They know I'm wildin', I need that respect

Seven hundred grams, icy baguettes

Pop Smoke, niggas know I'm up next

Drac' keep on shootin' until it's none left

I'm 823, yeah, I throw up the set

Twenty years old, but I move like the vet

You talk out your mouth, you better invest in a vest

Nigga, 'cause you could get left

Your bitch is a foreigner, huh?

I fuck her and pass her

Show her the difference between a dog and a master

Lamborghini truck, floorin'

Got your bitch in the back whorin'

She like, "Papi, I adore you"

I'm like, "Baby, I ain't normal," rrr

Thousand pair of Mike Amiris

But I still need more
