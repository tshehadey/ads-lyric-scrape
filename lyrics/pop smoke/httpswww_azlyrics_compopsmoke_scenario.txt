Pop Smoke - Scenario Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

(Traphouse Mob)



(Uh

Shout out my fifty clock niggas, my hundred clock niggas

Big 092MLBOA 'til they switch, uh

FTO shit, free Jeezy, free Clutch, free my nigga Jeezy, man

Tay-K, what up? Traff, what up? Uh)



Pull up, we snatching your babas

Big 092, those my guys

Pull up and change the scenario

Act up and bullets start tearing 'em, uh

My body different, hop in the foreign, I'm drifting

Tell Dread lift him, give him bald head like he Clifton

Pull up, we snatching your babas

Big 092, those my guys

Pull up and change the scenario

Act up and bullets start tearing 'em, uh

My body different, hop in the foreign, I'm drifting

Tell Dread lift him, give him bald head like he Clifton



I don't know why these fifty niggas talkin' hot

There be no fifty niggas on the scene

I got like fifty rounds up in that clip

I put that fifty clip up to your beanie

I let it bang for nothing

10K or better, race for nothin'

Zanotti got shot and he sang for nothin'

Hope the lawyer beat the case, a hundred

Nigga, I'm the big fool, give you 'nother two

I spent like four racks on Amiris

What the fuck they gon' tell him? The young niggas really

Step back for the three like I'm Curry (Swish)

Nigga, I'm a big souvie, I make a movie

Pull up and clap, you goofy

Nigga, I make an action movie, I make an action movie

Pul up to T-D-N-I-A

If we all getting money, then why hate?

Smooth head, she done rented

That boy is too benty

He 'bout to go fuck up the crime rate

I got twenty-twos up in my coupe

After business school, we pull up, we give him the boot

And I'm big flossy woo

No construction, but a nigga know I got the tool



Pull up, we snatching your babas

Big 092, those my guys

Pull up and change the scenario

Act up and bullets start tearing 'em, uh

My body different, hop in the foreign, I'm drifting

Tell Dread lift him, give him bald head like he Clifton

Pull up, we snatching your babas

Big 092, those my guys

Pull up and change the scenario

Act up and bullets start tearing 'em, uh

My body different, hop in the foreign, I'm drifting

Tell Dread lift him, give him bald head like he Clifton



Said I'm never lacking, always pistol packing

With them automatics, we gon' send 'em to Heaven

Pull up, what's crackin', nigga, what you jackin'?

Find his body up on Channel 11

Bag him up, groceries

Ain't no exposing me, ain't no controlling me

No, we don't fuck with them people

If I want you dead, then you dead

You know I got guns in the bed

Know I got one in the head

Free the caged whale up out the cage

Brody got locked for attempt

Ready, set, go

It's big 092 MLBOA

Hit that boy up in a GLA

Fly down your block like an eagle

And I'm so stuck in my ways

And I can't forget about the apes (Swish)

We gon' send shots where you stay

We gon' send shots where you lay

All the opps like, "Pop who?"

But I bet they wanna be Pop Smoke

Give him hot shells like taco

I'm big woo the flex, nigga, not cho

And I'm still swerving from potholes

And I'm still shooting at Tahoes

Everybody know I rock soft

Bad bitches, yeah, I got those



Pull up, we snatching your babas

Big 092, those my guys

Pull up and change the scenario

Act up and bullets start tearing 'em, uh

My body different, hop in the foreign, I'm drifting

Tell Dread lift him, give him bald head like he Clifton

Pull up, we snatching your babas

Big 092, those my guys

Pull up and change the scenario

Act up and bullets start tearing 'em, uh

My body different, hop in the foreign, I'm drifting

Tell Dread lift him, give him bald head like he Clifton
