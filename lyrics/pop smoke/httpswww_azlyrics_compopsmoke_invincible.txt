Pop Smoke - Invincible Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Yeah

Yeah, yeah

I said, "I feel invincible"

(Yoz, what you tellin' me?)

They like, "Poppy, what you gettin' to?" (To, to)

I pop a Perc', go retarded, wait

Haha, hahaha

Yeah (Ahaha), yeah, yeah, yeah

Woo, woo, yeah (To, to, grrt, grrt)

Yeah, yeah



I said, "I feel invincible" (Huh)

It's a hundred niggas in the spot

I'm walkin' through 'em (I'm walkin' through 'em)

It's eighty-five just to walk on

I don't talk to these niggas (Nah)

'Cause a lot of these niggas be corny (Corny)

I'm feeling horny (I'm feeling horny)

And I shoot like Robert Horry (Horry)

I'm off this percolator shit (Woo)

I got a percolated bitch (Percolated bitch)

I give her this percolated dick (Yeah)

I show her these percolated tricks

Pop Smoke, they know who run the city

Pop Smoke, nigga, you can ask Diddy

Pop Smoke bust up a Citi or TD

Pop Smoke goin' fifty for fifty



I pop a Perc, go retarded, then shoot up the party, then change the artillery

Energy

I'm givin' nothin' but energy

I give her Perky and Hennessy

I give two shots to the enemy, hope he remember me

What the fuck a nigga tellin' me?

I spent two hundred fifty on my wrist

I spent two hundred fifty on my bitch

Double G, niggas know I'm a threat

Walk in the spot and turn everybody Crip

DJ Clue, my nigga fuck with the Woos

Tell Spinking to play it back (Back)

While the Woos throw the bag

They know I'm shootin' for the stars

Aimin' for the moon (Moon)

I shoot at any opp (Opp)

'Cause niggas know I'm Woo (Woo)

Send that nigga to the medic

Everything raw, no edit

Pop Smoke did it



I said, "I feel invincible" (Huh)

It's a hundred niggas in the spot

I'm walkin' through 'em (I'm walkin' through 'em)

It's eighty-five just to walk on

I don't talk to these niggas (Nah)

'Cause a lot of these niggas be corny (Corny)

I'm feeling horny (I'm feeling horny)

And I shoot like Robert Horry (Horry)

I'm off this percolator shit (Woo)

I got a percolated bitch (Percolated bitch)

I give her this percolated dick (Yeah)

I show her these percolated tricks

Pop Smoke, they know who run the city

Pop Smoke, nigga, you can ask Diddy

Pop Smoke bust up a Citi or TD

Pop Smoke goin' fifty for fifty
