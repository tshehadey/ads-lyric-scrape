Pop Smoke - Armed N Dangerous (Charlie Sloth Freestyle) Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Look, look



I'm armed and dangerous

Ain't no parking at the light, nah, ain't no stainin' us, huh

Keep a K with us

Please don't, please don't play with us, nah

We up it, aimin', uh (Grrt)



Ain't no hidin', flossy, baby, that's where I be (Ah, ah)

Lymie, if you lookin' for me, you can find me (Find me)

Try me (Try me), niggas know that I'm grimy (Grimy)

Niggas know I'm on timin' (Woo), big body like a lineman (Woo)

I know how to vibe (Vibe, vibe), but no I ain't cool (Cool, cool)

Look at me funny (Look at me funny), bet I'll shoot up the room (Bet I'll shoot up the room)

Shoot out the coupe (Coupe), I let it boom (I let it boom)

Nah (Nah, woo), I don't play with these niggas, never (Never)

Play with it

Niggas know I keep a K with it

Ace Makaveli (Bah), wavin' it, wavin' it

All my apes on the loose (Nah)

Ain't no tamin' em, tamin' 'em (Nah, woo)

Step in the game and start changin' it, changin' it

Spin through your block, Tetris, bend it, bend it

All the opps want a shot, Beckham, Beckham, Beckham

If I don't got the chop, deck 'em, deck 'em, deck 'em

Got some brand new chops, test 'em, test 'em, test 'em

It's an opp in the spot, there he go, over there chillin' with his bitch

Point him out, where he at? Jeremi's gon' give the assist (Yeah)

Six shots, clip him, I bet I empty the clip

Pop Smoke on apeshit, but everybody know I'm Crip



I'm armed and dangerous

Ain't no parking at the light, nah, ain't no stainin' us, huh

Keep a K with us

Please don't, please don't play with us, nah

We up it, aimin', uh (Grrt)



I'm in the Bugatti, racin', pacer, pace him

Run him down, chase 'him, Draco, Drac' him

Extendo, thirty, Perc' head, 30

808 dirty, air it out, birdie

I keep a Smith n' like Stephen A., picante

In and out different states (Woo), duckin' the jakes (Duckin' the jakes)

Free Melly Gs, free G Nice, and free Rocky out the cage (All of my niggas), uh (Woo)

It's Big 092MLBOA, woo
