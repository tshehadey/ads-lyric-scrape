Pop Smoke - PTSD Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

My PTSD startin' to kick in so I gotta get high...



My PTSD startin' to kick in so I gotta get high

Trey shot that nigga out my car so now I gotta get low

I ain't no city boy 'cus I love my bitch

Nigga but that don't mean that I don't love my hoes

Niggas tried to smack me up so now I'm razorin him

Don't try and dap me up lil' nigga you are not my bro

Trey shot that nigga out my car so I gotta get low

They know we bend blocks, nigga welcome to the party



Got on the head of his only daughter

Then I dunk her head in that holy water

Niggas shootin' we gon shoot back

Sittin' at the table like the quarter 5

They know Imma do ya

Aimin' for medulla

Cooler than a cooler

Shoota with a shoota

AK on my shoulder like I'm Malcom X

'Cus I ain't goin' out like I'm Martin Luther

Nigga open up the door nigga I know you home

It's a hundred crip niggas standing on ya lawn

Gave up that cheese get that Provolone

And I ain't talkin' on the phone 'cus I ain't playin' with 'em

I got a K for the cuz if he hit you

If I call Nebby Bleu he come and get you

Call Dre that's the new Tom Brady

'Cus he be sendin' shots like it's Mason



My PTSD startin' to kick in so I gotta get high

Trey shot that nigga out my car so now I gotta get low

I ain't no city boy 'cus I love my bitch

Nigga but that don't mean that I don't love my hoes

Niggas tried to smack me up so now I'm razorin him

Don't try and dap me up lil' nigga you are not my bro

Trey shot that nigga out my car so I gotta get low

They know we bend blocks, nigga welcome to the party



Niggas always talkin' hot and runnin' they mouth

Until I kick down the door and run in they house

Have they mother on the floor wit the gun in her mouth

Like what's that shit up on the net that y'all was talkin' bout

I put that on my son that Imma take it there

Cus where you come from and where I come from I ain't playin fair

My lil homie died and I ain't drop a tear

I just roll a spliff and put it in the air

I'm big 092 niggas know I'm woo

I look a nigga in his face like "Who you talkin' to?"

I need 25k or I ain't walkin' through

I need 25k or I ain't walkin' through

I spent 20 on my wrist and 20 on a chain

I be spoiling myself so I could ease the pain

Digital Dash I be switching lanes

I was sitting on the bench but now I'm in the game



My PTSD startin' to kick in so I gotta get high

Trey shot that nigga out my car so now I gotta get low

I ain't no city boy 'cus I love my bitch

Nigga but that don't mean that I don't love my hoes

Niggas tried to smack me up so now I'm razorin him

Don't try and dap me up lil' nigga you are not my bro

Trey shot that nigga out my car so I gotta get low

They know we bend blocks, nigga welcome to the party
