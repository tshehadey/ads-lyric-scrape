Pop Smoke - Meet The Woo Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

(This is a Melo beat)



Baby girl come and meet the woo

She know we keep a tool

Big knockin' on my body

Watch who you speaking to

Baby girl come and meet the woo

Big knockin' on my body

The beat went off?



I go H like Avelli, got treesh in the deli

Shawty want fuck over, that just some heli

Don't call my phone, got the feds on my celly

Fly to Miami, put dick in her belly

Wanna make bread, tell 'em open up Relly

TD, OA, Tander, City, Chevy

Pull up in rovers, catch him it's over, spin it like jail it's ocer

Shoot with that holder, shooting like Korver, put that boy head on his shoulders

Swervin', give em' two shots I'd he twerlin'

Burn him, I promise it's gon' be a murder

If I catch him I hurt him, slide him I murk him, look at that boy lookin' nervous

I got 1 thing for sure, I got 2 things for certain , wrap that boy up in a curtain

Touchy, I dropped 38 on this touchy

I made a flip off this puppy

I turned that boy to a duppy

Balmain, true blue, ocean, mystery, potion, back out, toast him, Pop Smoke, run him, over, over, over (err)



Baby girl come and meet the woo

She know we keep a tool

Big knockin' on my body watch who you speakin' to

Baby girl come and meet the woo

Big knockin' on my body

Watch who you speakin' to
