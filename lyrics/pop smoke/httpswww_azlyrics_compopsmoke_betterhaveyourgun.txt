Pop Smoke - Better Have Your Gun Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

(See, because I am going to kill the fuckery over there...

And people is going to be in demand of all the truth...)



When you come to flossy, better have your gun

What's the key to the block? Better have your gun

Disrespect the gang, better have your gun

Or you dropping the woo, better have your gun

Talk down on my name, better have your gun

Or you reach for the chain, better have your gun

If you step on my Diors, Diors, better have your gun

Or you laugh at my pain, better have your gun, look



You shot in the air, is you scared of me?

2Pacs, I ain't mad at you

Shot a nigga, he was laughing, huh

The same nigga crying after, huh

Put a pussy on a platter, huh

Shot your mans and now they adding up

Your mans down and now you mad as fuck

I fucked your bitch and then I'm passing her

What the fuck is you telling me? I got the pedigree

In the hood, I'm fighting felonies

It's a whole bunch of jealousy in the air

What the fuck a nigga telling me?

Shoot a nigga, go to jail for it

'Cause I know I got the bail for it

For my gun, I'll die for it

Get on the stand and lie for it

Half rapper, half drug dealer

Got a bird up on my wrist

Brought the McLaren to the hood

Niggas can't get into this

Late nights in Puerto Rico

Breaking down a half a kilo

Eating chicharon with the people

Having an orgy with three hoes



When you come to flossy, better have your gun

What's the key to the block? Better have your gun

Disrespect the gang, better have your gun

Or you dropping the woo, better have your gun

Talk down on my name, better have your gun

Or you reach for the chain, better have your gun

If you step on my Diors, Diors, better have your gun

Or you laugh at my pain, better have your gun, look



Niggas talking 'bout a rhyme, I'm talking 'bout guns and crime

I'm fuckin' with you and yours if you think that you fuckin' with mines

I'm a diamond in the rough, all I wanna do is shine

Late nights up in the 9, just know I keep a nine

I ain't with the bitching and snitching

I ain't with the politicking

Rather sit up in the jail

Or swim with the fishes

You ain't gon' ever catch me slipping

Off the 'TrÃ³n, I be sipping

Stove hot, I be whipping

Lot of heat up in kitchen

In the hills up in Cali

Pink Runtz, smoking mad weed

Fuckin' on a lil' mama

Lightskin with a jatty

I ain't a gangster if you ask me

But lil' nigga, don't put it past me

I put your body on standby

While I blow a dub like Max B



When you come to flossy, better have your gun

What's the key to the block? Better have your gun

Disrespect the gang, better have your gun

Or you dropping the woo, better have your gun

Talk down on my name, better have your gun

Or you reach for the chain, better have your gun

If you step on my Diors, Diors, better have your gun

Or you laugh at my pain, better have your gun



Better have your gun, better have your gun

Better have your gun, better have your gun

Better have your gun, better have your gun

Better have your gun, better have your gun

Better have your gun, better have your gun

Better have your gun, better have your gun

Better have your gun...
