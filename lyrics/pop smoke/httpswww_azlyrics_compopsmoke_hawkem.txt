Pop Smoke - Hawk Em Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

(Traphouse Mob)

Uh

Big, what up?

Trav, what up?

(This is a Melo beat)

Yo, Boof, what up?



It's big 092MLBOA, uh

K with it, K with it

Niggas know that we don't play with it

Big .38 gon' hawk 'em

Two stripes, sauce it

Bentley, park it

Hit him up if he Team Larkin

I keep a TEC when I'm walkin'

Hands off the whip when I'm parking, uh

It's still Amiri for the denim

I bet I send 'em to heaven

They take advantage if you let 'em, uh

Blue dot, stalking

I like my white opps blue, uh

K with it, K with it

'Cause I got some black ops too

Walk in, walk out

What the fuck is all the talk 'bout?

I bet I shake up the room

Get straight passion

Zip 'em up, bag 'em

Louis V, Louis V, Louis V

SP, Zoovie

I bet he make a movie (Woop, woop)

I bet he clap your kufi

K with it

Niggas know that we don't play with it

I make an action movie

Raining, pouring

Say the wrong thing and we on 'em

Three stripes, chalk 'em

Lighting, thunder

And bro just beat a body

They tried to give him a quarter

Earthquake, cordless

Pop Smoke gorgeous

I'm a gentlemen and gangster

Double G

Niggas know there's only one of me

Big .38 gon' hawk 'em
