Traphouse Mob

Uh, look



I got that sit 'em down feeling

Get up, can't sit around feeling

I got that drill 'em now feeling

Get up and drill 'em now feeling

Like me, undone, I got a drill 'em now feeling

Back out, brush 'em, no, I can't sit around feeling

I got that sit 'em down feeling

Get up, can't sit around feeling

I got that drill 'em now feeling

Get up and drill 'em now feeling

Like me, undone, I got a drill 'em now feeling

Back out, brush 'em, no, I can't sit around feeling



Lightning, thunder, put 'em under

Back out, brush 'em, I got that drill 'em now feeling

I got that cash out feeling, I got that touchdown feeling

I got that back out, get 'em, if you gon' run up with 'em

Big .38, hawk 'em, big bands, ain't no walking

I ain't really with the talking, I got that drill 'em now feeling

I got that run 'em down feeling

I got that kill 'em now feeling

I make 'em spin around spinning

Know my gun get around, get 'em



I got that sit 'em down feeling

Get up, can't sit around feeling

I got that drill 'em now feeling

Get up and drill 'em now feeling

Like me, undone, I got a drill 'em now feeling

Back out, brush 'em, no, I can't sit around feeling

I got that sit 'em down feeling

Get up, can't sit around feeling

I got that drill 'em now feeling

Get up and drill 'em now feeling

Like me, undone, I got a drill 'em now feeling

Back out, brush 'em, no, I can't sit around feeling



I got that big bag feeling

I got that tre pound feeling

EMS, get 'em now feeling

I got that man down feeling

I got that yellow tape feeling

Bullets gon' penetrate feeling

I got that drop them rakes feeling

Tell that pussy nigga move up

I spent fifty on a jeweler

Niggas know that I be jeweled up

Don't make a body go missing

Niggas know that I be tooled up

Glock-30 with a ruler

Since a youngin, been a ooter

Niggas know that boy a shooter

Don't make me go smooth up

A-23, sanction

Everybody know I'm woo'd up

That's a Ruger with a Ruger

That's a shooter with a shooter



I got that sit 'em down feeling

Get up, can't sit around feeling

I got that drill 'em now feeling

Get up and drill 'em now feeling

Like me, undone, I got a drill 'em now feeling

Back out, brush 'em, no, I can't sit around feeling

I got that sit 'em down feeling

Get up, can't sit around feeling

I got that drill 'em now feeling

Get up and drill 'em now feeling

Like me, undone, I got a drill 'em now feeling

Back out, brush 'em, no, I can't sit around feeling
